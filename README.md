# Smoothie Recipes

This smoothie recipe page is designed to show recipes via flip cards. The front has an image and the description of the smoothie. The back has the ingredients. 
The smoothies require all ingredients to be added together and blended - unless otherwise noted. 

## Please Note:
This page works best on Chrome ... during the full moon ... in a darkened room ... while burning sage candles... 
Joking aside, it does work best on Chrome. I will try to make it function for other browsers as I have ability to do so.
